Foundations of Software -- Fall 2010
====================================
I'm teaching [Foundations of Software](http://lamp.epfl.ch/teaching/foundations_of_software/) instead of Martin Odersky in the Fall semester of 2010. The textbook for the course is Benjamin C. Pierce's excellent [Types and Programming Languages](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/).
